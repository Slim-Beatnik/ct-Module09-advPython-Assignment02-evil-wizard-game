**The Assignment:**

    **üåê Advanced Python Module Project |  Defeat the Evil Wizard**

### **OVERVIEW**

In this mini-project, you will create a hero character and battle the powerful Evil Wizard. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to extend starter code, customize your character, and add new functionality. Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. Your task is to modify t he starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing your own logic and design.

---

## **üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

* **Understand OOP Principles:** Practice inheritance, methods, and interactions between objects in Python.  
* **Build Interactive Programs:** Implement a menu system for a turn-based game.  
* **Design Game Logic:** Manage attacks, healing, and enemy interactions to make gameplay dynamic.

---

üí¨ **Project Presentation Reminder**  
As part of your final deliverables for this module, you‚Äôll also give a short presentation of your project. This can be done live during a [weekly Q\&A session](https://codingtemple.disco.co/events/UHJvZHVjdEFwcDoyNzQwMTU=?calendarTab=upcoming), recorded and submitted to Google Classroom, or shared directly with your Student Success Manager. If you'd like to schedule a 1-on-1 presentation, [click here to book a time](https://scheduler.zoom.us/d/nsl-rf0v/software-engineering-1-on-1-presentations).

## **üîß STARTER CODE**

Start Code is attached at the bottom of this document so make sure to scroll down to get it before you start\!  Extend it to complete the project.

---

## **üìã PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

### **Create Your Own Character Classes:**

* Add **two new character classes** in addition to Warrior and Mage. Examples include:  
  * **Archer**: A ranged attacker with abilities to shoot arrows and evade attacks.  
  * **Paladin**: A defensive hero who can heal and shield against attacks.

### **Implement Special Abilities:**

* Each character must have **two unique abilities**, such as:  
  * **Archer**: "Quick Shot" (double arrow attack) and "Evade" (evades the next attack ).  
  * **Paladin**: "Holy Strike" (bonus damage) and "Divine Shield" (blocks the next attack).

### **Add a Healing Mechanic:**

* Implement a heal() method that restores health but does not exceed the maximum.

### **Randomize Attack Damage:**

* Modify the attack() method to deal **random damage within a range**.

### **Build a Turn-Based Battle System:**

* Players must choose actions such as **attacking, healing, using abilities,** or **viewing stats**.

### **Evil Wizard Logic:**

* The evil wizard should **regenerate health** and **attack the player** after each turn.

### **Display Victory/Defeat Messages:**

* End the game with a **victory message** for the player or a **defeat message** if the wizard wins.

---

## **üì§ DELIVERABLES**

* A **Python script** containing:  
  * Four character classes (including two new ones).  
  * Two unique abilities for each character.  
  * A working **turn-based battle system**.  
* Display **victory or defeat messages** at the end.

---

## **üöÄ BONUS TASKS (Optional):**

* Create additional character classes with more complex mechanics.  
* Add **random elements** to the wizard‚Äôs attacks or **advanced abilities** (e.g., summoning minions).

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Attributes include:
          my_turn -- a boolean to toggle turns
          ALL ~_turns default 0, number designating number of turns character will have status, if ~_turns will return false if 0, so it's perfect for decrementing once set
          invulnerable_turns -- turns invincible
          invulnerable_type -- ['is shielded', 'is evading', 'has a magic barrier'], list for quick printing: {player.name} {player.invulnerable_type} and took no damage
          cooldown_turns - turns in cooldown
          paralyzed_turns - turns paralyzed
          # verba = [noun, verb, past-participle, past-participle, noun, verb ending in -es]
          verba -- by far the weakest attribute, but it allows class based special ability text
          opponents = [None] -- list of opponents, used for working with wizard once he's summoned a teammate.
          team = [] -- can't initialize list by inserting self, it will cause unending loops -- used to align summoned characters to player and wizard team - or heal all, or make invulnerable abilities

          specials = {
            '1': {
                'type': '', # ability or attack -- unused, but it would be good for character power balancing
                'func': None, # backend 
                'args': [], # custom args list for flexibility
                'name': '', # name for function output, and description
                'print_phrase': '', # ability description for function output
                'description': '' # description for turn_menu in battle() -- see main
            },
            '2': {},
            '3': {},
            '4': {}
        }
        
        This is used to allow SummonedEntity class to init light and heavy attack names, and class based names for player classes
        attack_names = {
            'light': '',
            'heavy': ''
        } 


- [ ] 3 main files character.py, player_classes.py, and npc_classes.py
          npc and player initialize w/ adjustable names, npc class SummonedEntities also come with the option of setting health and strength stats, each class utilizes specials dictionary, containing string numerical keys, for easy use with numerical input()s allowing for scallability.
- [ ] Attack function takes in a tuple populated by the light_attack or heavy_attack functions. The tuples populated use randint to get a number related to attack_power attribute, no overriding is required due to a .__module__ conditional which eliminates the need for the target_opponent function which iterates over opponents attribute 
- [ ] Traveler class, not featured in the menu is a class that uses partial() to get special functions from other player classes
- [ ] rich library is the only requirement, I'd like to impliment it, but the reorganization of logic would be too time intensive.
